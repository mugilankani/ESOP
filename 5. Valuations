# Lesson 5: Valuations - The Numbers Behind Your Equity üí∞

## What is a Valuation? The Price Tag on Your Company üè∑Ô∏è

Imagine you're selling your handmade jewelry at a craft fair. How do you decide what price to put on each piece? That's essentially what a company valuation is‚Äîfiguring out what a business is worth, whether it's worth $10 thousand, $10 million, or $10 billion.

A **valuation** is the process of determining how much a company is worth. It's a critical number because it affects everything from how much investment money a company can raise to how much your stock options are potentially worth.

### The House Analogy:

```
üè† Company = House
üí∞ Valuation = House market value
üìä Valuation methods = Home appraisal techniques
üßæ 409A valuation = Official government assessment
üèóÔ∏è Growth stage = House renovations increasing value
```

## Why Valuations Matter: The Domino Effect üé≤

### For the Company:
1. **Fundraising:** Determines how much money you get for what percentage of the company
2. **Option Pricing:** Sets the legally required strike price for options
3. **Acquisition Discussions:** Starting point for sale negotiations
4. **Strategic Planning:** Helps decide if you can afford certain acquisitions or expansions

### For You (The Employee):
1. **Option Value:** The gap between your strike price and current value
2. **Exercise Decisions:** Affects whether it's worth buying your options
3. **Tax Implications:** Determines potential tax bill when exercising
4. **Wealth Planning:** Helps you understand your potential equity value

## Valuation Comedy Central: Startup Humor üòÇ

**Founder at pitch meeting:** "We're raising $2 million at a $20 million valuation."  
**Investor:** "How did you arrive at that number?"  
**Founder:** "Well, similar companies are valued at 10x revenue. We have no revenue, but we've projected $2M for next year, so 10 times that!"  
**Investor:** "So you're valuing yourselves at 10x your imaginary revenue?"  
**Founder:** "Precisely! And we're giving you a 15% discount because we like you."

**VC Partner to Associate:** "What do you think of this startup?"  
**Associate:** "Their valuation is completely absurd."  
**VC Partner:** "I agree. Let's invest immediately before someone else does."

**Employee:** "My options are worth $1M on paper!"  
**Friend:** "What's the company valued at?"  
**Employee:** "The last round was at $2B."  
**Friend:** "What's their annual revenue?"  
**Employee:** "$5M."  
**Friend:** "So they're valued at 400x revenue? Good luck with that..."

## Types of Valuations: Different Purposes, Different Numbers üìä

### 1. Financing Valuation (For Funding) üíº
- **Purpose:** Determine company value for investment rounds
- **Who sets it:** Negotiation between company and investors
- **Key types:**
  - **Pre-money:** Company value BEFORE investment
  - **Post-money:** Company value AFTER investment (Pre-money + new money)
- **Example:**
  - Pre-money valuation: $10M
  - Investment amount: $2M
  - Post-money valuation: $12M
  - Investor ownership: 16.7% ($2M √∑ $12M)

**Dad Joke:** "Why was the startup afraid of the post-money valuation? Because it was always bigger than it expected!" ü•Å

### 2. 409A Valuation (For Tax Compliance) ‚öñÔ∏è
- **Purpose:** Determine "fair market value" for setting option strike prices
- **Who sets it:** Independent third-party valuation firm
- **Legal requirement:** IRS requires it to avoid tax penalties
- **Key characteristic:** Almost always LOWER than the financing valuation
- **Typical ratio:** 409A valuation is often 10-30% of the last financing valuation
- **Example:**
  - Financing valuation: $100M
  - 409A valuation: $25M
  - This means your option strike price is based on the lower $25M valuation (good for you!)

**409A Joke:** "The 409A valuation is the only time startup founders celebrate their company being worth LESS money!" ü•Å

### 3. Acquisition Valuation (For Selling) üõí
- **Purpose:** Determine purchase price when selling the company
- **Who sets it:** Negotiation between acquirer and company
- **Key factors:** Strategic value, synergies, market position, growth rate
- **Example:**
  - Revenue: $20M
  - Acquisition price: $100M
  - Multiple: 5x revenue

**Acquisition Joke:** "The ideal acquisition valuation is when both the buyer and the seller feel they've gotten away with robbery." ü•Å

## The 409A Valuation: Your Options' Price Tag üíµ

### What is a 409A Valuation?
A 409A valuation is a formal, independent assessment of a company's fair market value (FMV) for tax purposes. Named after Section 409A of the IRS tax code, it determines the minimum legal strike price for stock options.

### Why It Exists:
- Before 2005: Companies set option prices artificially low
- 2005: IRS created Section 409A after scandals (Enron, etc.)
- Now: Independent valuations required to avoid massive tax penalties

### How Often It Happens:
- Every 12 months (minimum)
- After significant events (major funding, business model change)
- Before major option grants

### The Process:
1. Company hires independent valuation firm
2. Valuation firm collects financial data, projections, comparables
3. Firm applies valuation methodologies
4. Company receives formal 409A valuation report
5. Board approves the new fair market value (FMV)
6. New option grants use this price as strike price

**409A Process Joke:** "Getting a 409A valuation is like going to the dentist‚Äîit's expensive, slightly painful, required regularly, and you hope for a good number at the end." ü•Å

## Valuation Methods: The Recipe Book üìò

### 1. Discounted Cash Flow (DCF): The Future Money Machine
- **How it works:** Project future cash flows and discount to present value
- **Formula:** Value = Sum of (Future Cash Flows √∑ (1+r)^n)
  - r = discount rate (higher for risky companies)
  - n = year in the future
- **Best for:** Companies with predictable cash flows
- **Startup challenge:** Hard to predict future cash flows for new companies

**DCF Example:**
- Projected cash flows: $1M (Year 1), $2M (Year 2), $4M (Year 3)
- Discount rate: 30% (high because startup is risky)
- DCF Value = $1M√∑1.3 + $2M√∑1.3¬≤ + $4M√∑1.3¬≥ ‚âà $4.2M

**DCF Joke:** "DCF is like predicting how many cookies your toddler's lemonade stand will sell in 5 years... while the toddler is still learning to talk." ü•Å

### 2. Comparable Company Analysis: The Peer Comparison
- **How it works:** Look at similar public companies' multiples
- **Common multiples:**
  - Revenue multiple (e.g., 10x annual revenue)
  - EBITDA multiple (e.g., 15x EBITDA)
  - User/Customer multiple (e.g., $100 per active user)
- **Best for:** Companies in established industries with public peers
- **Startup challenge:** Finding truly comparable companies

**Comparable Example:**
- Your SaaS company: $2M ARR, growing 100% annually
- Public SaaS companies: Trading at 15x ARR on average
- But your company is smaller and riskier, so apply a 50% discount
- Comparable Value = $2M √ó 15 √ó 0.5 = $15M

**Comparables Joke:** "Comparable analysis for startups is like comparing your toddler's height to NBA players and saying 'with a 90% discount, my kid is comparable to LeBron James!'" ü•Å

### 3. Precedent Transaction Analysis: The Past Deals
- **How it works:** Look at acquisition prices of similar companies
- **Formula:** Apply similar multiples from past transactions
- **Best for:** Companies considering acquisition or with many acquired peers
- **Startup challenge:** Lack of public data on private acquisitions

**Transaction Example:**
- Similar startup acquired last year: $30M for $3M revenue (10x multiple)
- Your startup: $2M revenue
- Precedent Value = $2M √ó 10 = $20M

**Precedent Joke:** "Using past transactions to value startups is like pricing your house based on what your neighbor sold for‚Äîexcept your neighbor's house was in a different city, sold during a different housing market, and may have had invisible gold bricks in the walls." ü•Å

### 4. Venture Capital Method: The Backward Math
- **How it works:**
  - Start with projected EXIT value (5-10 years out)
  - Apply VCs' required return rate (35-70% annually)
  - Work backwards to current value
- **Formula:** Present Value = Exit Value √∑ (1+r)^n
  - r = required annual return (e.g., 50%)
  - n = years to exit
- **Best for:** Early-stage startups raising VC money

**VC Method Example:**
- Projected exit: $100M in 5 years
- VC required return: 40% annually
- Present Value = $100M √∑ (1.4)^5 ‚âà $18.6M

**VC Method Joke:** "The VC method is like planning your retirement by assuming you'll win the lottery, but then budgeting as if you'll only win the second-place prize." ü•Å

## Valuation in Real Life: The MediTech Tale üì±

Let's follow a fictional health tech startup called "MediTech" through its valuation journey:

### Year 0: Formation
- Two founders with just an idea
- Self-valuation for friends & family: $2 million
- First 409A valuation: $500,000 (25% of financing valuation)
- Initial option strike price: $0.05 per share

**Inception Joke:** "The founders valued their PowerPoint deck at $2 million. Surprisingly, three people agreed with them!" ü•Å

### Year 2: Seed Round
- Product launched, 500 early users, no revenue yet
- Seed financing valuation: $10 million pre-money
- 409A valuation: $3 million (30% of financing)
- New option strike price: $0.30 per share

**Seed Stage Joke:** "The app has more bugs than users, but the valuation has more zeroes than both combined." ü•Å

### Year 3: Series A
- 10,000 users, $1M annual revenue
- Series A valuation: $30 million pre-money
- 409A valuation: $10 million
- New option strike price: $1.00 per share

**Series A Joke:** "The company is now worth $3,000 per customer. If only we could sell each customer for that much!" ü•Å

### Year 5: Series B
- 100,000 users, $10M annual revenue
- Series B valuation: $100 million pre-money
- 409A valuation: $30 million
- New option strike price: $3.00 per share

**Series B Joke:** "We're now projecting to be profitable by 2030, which our investors have agreed means we're basically profitable already." ü•Å

### Year 7: Acquisition
- 500,000 users, $30M annual revenue
- Acquisition offer: $300 million (10x revenue)
- Final value of earliest employee options:
  - Grant: 10,000 options at $0.05 strike price
  - Cost to exercise: $500 (10,000 √ó $0.05)
  - Value at acquisition: $3 million (10,000 √ó $300 per share)
  - Net gain: $2,999,500 ($3M - $500)

**Acquisition Joke:** "After 7 years, the early employee made $3M from options. That's only $428,500 per year, which in San Francisco just barely covers rent!" ü•Å

## How Valuations Affect Your Options: The Bottom Line üí∏

### 1. Strike Price Setting
- Higher 409A valuation = Higher strike price
- Higher strike price = More money to exercise
- Higher strike price = Potentially lower profit

**Example:** If the 409A valuation doubles from $10M to $20M, new options might have a $2.00 strike price instead of $1.00.

### 2. Exercise Decision
- Gap between strike price and current value = Your paper profit
- Wider gap = More attractive to exercise
- Narrower gap = Less attractive to exercise

**Example:** Options with $1 strike price when shares are worth $10 are much more attractive than options with $9 strike price.

### 3. Tax Implications
- Higher 409A = Higher strike price = Lower AMT tax potential
- Lower 409A compared to true value = Bigger bargain = Bigger tax hit

**Example:** If you exercise at $1 when true value is $10, you might owe tax on the $9 "bargain element."

### 4. Psychological Impact
- Higher valuation = More exciting to employees
- Lower valuation = Not as motivating

**Example:** "My options are in a $1B company!" sounds better than "My options are in a $100M company!"

## Interpreting Valuation Numbers: Reality Check üîç

### 1. Financing Valuation vs. 409A Valuation
- Financing: What investors pay for preferred stock with special rights
- 409A: Fair market value of common stock (what employees get)
- Typical ratio: 409A is 20-40% of financing valuation
- Example: $50M financing valuation might mean $15M 409A valuation

### 2. Public Valuation Multiples vs. Private
- Public companies: Often valued at 5-15x revenue
- Hyper-growth startups: Sometimes 20-100x revenue
- Rule of thumb: The faster the growth, the higher the multiple
- Example: 100% YoY growth might justify 20x revenue multiple

### 3. Pre-Money vs. Post-Money
- $10M pre-money + $5M investment = $15M post-money
- New investor owns 33.3% ($5M √∑ $15M)
- Your ownership is diluted by 33.3% (e.g., 1% becomes 0.67%)

**Valuation Clarification Joke:** "Startup valuations are like dating app profiles‚Äîthe numbers are technically accurate, but missing a lot of important context." ü•Å

## Valuation Red Flags: When Numbers Lie üö©

### 1. Extremely High Revenue Multiples
- Warning sign: Valued at >30x current revenue
- Reality check: Even the hottest public tech companies rarely sustain above 20x
- Risk: Future down round likely

### 2. Flat or Down Rounds
- Warning sign: New funding at same or lower valuation than previous round
- Reality check: Indicates growth slower than expected or market correction
- Risk: Existing options may be "underwater" (strike price > current value)

### 3. Post-Money vs. Pre-Money Confusion
- Warning sign: "We're raising $5M at $20M" (ambiguous)
- Reality check: Always clarify if valuation is pre-money or post-money
- Risk: Could mean 20% investor ownership or 25% (big difference!)

### 4. Wild Valuation Jumps
- Warning sign: Valuation jumps from $10M to $100M in one round
- Reality check: Business fundamentals rarely justify 10x jumps
- Risk: Sets unrealistic expectations for future growth

## Real-World Valuation Examples: Famous Companies üåç

### 1. Facebook Valuation Journey:
- **2004:** Started in a dorm room
- **2005:** $100M valuation (first VC round)
- **2007:** $15B valuation (Microsoft investment)
- **2012:** $104B valuation (IPO)
- **2024:** ~$1.2T valuation (public market)

**Early Employee Impact:** $100K investment in Facebook's first round would be worth over $1 billion today.

### 2. Uber Valuation Journey:
- **2010:** $5.4M valuation (seed)
- **2011:** $60M valuation (Series A)
- **2014:** $18B valuation (Series D)
- **2018:** $72B valuation (pre-IPO)
- **2019:** $82B valuation (IPO)
- **2024:** ~$150B valuation (public market)

**Valuation Reality Check:** Despite the amazing growth, note that it took Uber 14 years to grow from its IPO valuation, and experienced periods of being worth less than at IPO.

**Uber Joke:** "Uber's long-term business strategy: 1) Lose money on every ride, 2) Make it up in volume!" ü•Å

## Valuation in Simple Terms: The 5-Year-Old Explanation üë∂

**5-year-old version:** "Imagine you made a really cool sandcastle. Your friend says, 'I'll give you 5 cookies if I can own half of your sandcastle!' If 5 cookies buys half, that means your whole sandcastle is worth 10 cookies. That's the valuation! But different friends might offer different numbers of cookies for the same sandcastle, because they each think it's worth a different amount."

## DIY Valuation Exercise: Price Your Imaginary Startup üèóÔ∏è

Let's value your fictional startup, "PetChat" (an AI chat service for pets):

1. **Revenue Multiple Method:**
   - Annual revenue: $2 million
   - Similar companies trade at: 10x revenue
   - Calculated valuation: $20 million

2. **User Multiple Method:**
   - Active users: 100,000
   - Industry values users at: $100 per user
   - Calculated valuation: $10 million

3. **Growth-Adjusted Method:**
   - Growing 200% year-over-year (extremely fast)
   - Base multiple: 10x revenue
   - Growth premium: +5x
   - Calculated valuation: $30 million (15x $2M)

4. **DCF Method:**

   - Discount rate: 40% (high-risk startup)
   - Terminal multiple after 5 years: 10x profit
   - DCF valuation: Approximately $25 million

**Question:** Based on these methods, what valuation range would you propose to investors?
**Answer:** $20-30 million pre-money valuation range, with strong justification for the top end if growth continues.

## Common Valuation Mistakes: The Danger Zone ‚ö†Ô∏è

### 1. Confusing Valuation Types
Thinking your financing valuation and 409A valuation should be the same

### 2. Using the Wrong Multiples
Applying software company multiples to hardware businesses

### 3. Ignoring Liquidation Preferences
Not accounting for investor preferences when calculating your common share value

### 4. Over-relying on Comparable Companies
Claiming you're "just like Airbnb" when you're actually quite different

### 5. Projecting Unrealistic Growth
Building models assuming 300% growth for multiple years

## Valuation Memes to Remember üòÇ

![Founder negotiating valuation: "Our startup is worth $50M because we have the potential to be worth $5B someday. This is what we in the startup world call 'math'."]

![409A valuation versus financing round: "For investors, we're worth $100M. For the IRS, we're worth $20M. For our actual bank account, we're worth $43.28."]

## Key Takeaways: Valuation Essentials

1. **Different valuation types serve different purposes** (financing vs. 409A vs. acquisition)
2. **409A valuations are almost always lower** than financing valuations
3. **Your strike price is based on the 409A valuation**, not the flashy financing valuation
4. **Valuations typically increase with funding rounds**, raising strike prices for new option grants
5. **Earlier employees typically have much lower strike prices** than later employees
6. **Valuation methods vary** but usually involve multiples or future projections
7. **Higher valuations aren't always better** if they lead to down rounds or unrealistic expectations

## Questions to Ask About Your Company's Valuation ü§î

1. What was the last financing valuation and when?
2. What is the current 409A valuation?
3. What valuation method was used for the 409A?
4. How does our valuation compare to similar companies?
5. What metrics would drive our valuation higher?

In our next fascinating episode, we'll explore the world of Financial Instruments in the startup ecosystem. We'll decode SAFEs, convertible notes, warrants, and other exotic financial tools that companies use to raise money and compensate employees. You'll learn how these instruments can affect your equity and what to look for in the fine print!

*Remember: Valuation is both an art and a science. The numbers may seem precise, but they're based on assumptions about the future and negotiations between parties. The true value of a company is ultimately what someone is willing to pay for it, whether that's an investor buying a small stake or an acquirer buying the whole thing!*
