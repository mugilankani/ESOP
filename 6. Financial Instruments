# Lesson 6: Financial Instruments - The Startup Money Toolkit üíº

## What Are Financial Instruments in Startups? The Equity Toolbox üß∞

Imagine you're building a house. You wouldn't use just a hammer for everything‚Äîyou'd have different tools for different tasks. Similarly, companies use various **financial instruments** to raise money, compensate employees, and structure ownership.

Financial instruments are the legal documents and agreements that define how someone invests in, or receives ownership from, a company. They're the formal contracts that specify exactly what investors or employees get in exchange for their money or work.

### The Restaurant Analogy:

```
üçΩÔ∏è Company = Restaurant
üí∞ Investors = People paying for meals
üßæ Financial instruments = Different menu options
üçó Common stock = Regular menu items
ü•© Preferred stock = Premium menu with special service
üîÑ Convertible note = Gift card that turns into a discount card later
üé´ SAFE = Pre-paid meal to be determined later
```

## Types of Financial Instruments: The Startup Buffet üç±

### 1. Common Stock: The Basic Dish üçó
- **What it is:** The most basic form of company ownership
- **Who typically gets it:** Founders, employees, sometimes early investors
- **Key rights:** Basic ownership, typically with voting rights
- **Downsides:** Last in line for money if company sells or liquidates
- **Example paperwork:** Stock Purchase Agreement or Stock Option Agreement

**Common Stock Joke:** "Common stock is like flying economy class‚Äîyou get to the same destination as first class, but with no legroom and after everyone else has deplaned." ü•Å

### 2. Preferred Stock: The VIP Treatment ü•©
- **What it is:** Stock with special privileges beyond common stock
- **Who typically gets it:** Venture capital investors, institutional investors
- **Key rights:**
  - Liquidation preference (get money back before common)
  - Anti-dilution protection (protection against down rounds)
  - Board seats (governance rights)
  - Pro-rata rights (right to invest in future rounds)
  - Information rights (access to financial statements)
- **Series naming:** Series A, Series B, Series C, etc. (sequential funding rounds)
- **Example paperwork:** Stock Purchase Agreement with detailed "Investor Rights"

**Preferred Stock Joke:** "Preferred stock is like having a FastPass at Disney World‚Äîyou paid extra to skip past all those common stockholders waiting in the regular line for their money." ü•Å

### 3. Convertible Notes: The IOU That Transforms üîÑ
- **What it is:** Short-term debt that converts to equity in the future
- **Who typically gets it:** Early-stage investors, bridge round investors
- **Key features:**
  - Principal amount (the investment amount)
  - Interest rate (typically 4-8%)
  - Maturity date (when it must convert or be repaid)
  - Discount rate (typically 15-25% off next round price)
  - Valuation cap (maximum conversion price)
- **Conversion triggers:** Usually the next equity financing round
- **Example paperwork:** Convertible Note Purchase Agreement

**Convertible Note Joke:** "A convertible note is like a caterpillar that turns into a butterfly, except the butterfly is worth 20% more and the metamorphosis is triggered by a Series A financing." ü•Å

### 4. SAFE (Simple Agreement for Future Equity): The Modern Shortcut üé´
- **What it is:** Right to future equity without debt components
- **Who typically gets it:** Early-stage investors, accelerators
- **Key features:**
  - No interest rate (unlike convertible notes)
  - No maturity date (can exist indefinitely)
  - Discount rate and/or valuation cap
  - Various trigger events for conversion
- **Invented by:** Y Combinator in 2013
- **Example paperwork:** SAFE Agreement (standardized by YC)

**SAFE Joke:** "SAFEs were created because convertible notes were too complicated. Now we have convertible notes, SAFEs, post-money SAFEs, and pre-money SAFEs. Mission accomplished on simplification!" ü•Å

### 5. Warrants: The Long-Term Coupons üéüÔ∏è
- **What it is:** Right to purchase shares at a set price for an extended period
- **Who typically gets it:** Strategic partners, lenders, sometimes investors
- **Key features:**
  - Exercise price (what you pay per share)
  - Expiration date (typically 5-10 years)
  - Number of shares covered
- **Common usage:** Given to banks along with venture debt, or as deal sweeteners
- **Example paperwork:** Warrant Agreement

**Warrant Joke:** "A warrant is like finding a coupon for 50% off that doesn't expire for 10 years. Whether the store still exists in 10 years is a totally different question." ü•Å

### 6. Restricted Stock Units (RSUs): The Future Stock Promise üìÖ
- **What it is:** Promise to receive actual stock upon meeting conditions
- **Who typically gets it:** Employees at later-stage companies
- **Key features:**
  - Two vesting triggers:
    - Time-based vesting (similar to options)
    - Liquidity event (IPO or acquisition)
  - No purchase required (unlike options)
  - Taxed as income when both triggers are met
- **Common usage:** Pre-IPO companies and public companies
- **Example paperwork:** RSU Agreement

**RSU Joke:** "RSUs are like being told 'I'll give you this great gift, but only if you stay at this job for years AND the company goes public.' It's the ultimate 'conditions apply' compensation." ü•Å

## SAFEs in Detail: The Startup's Favorite Tool üõ†Ô∏è

### Why SAFEs Were Created:
- Convertible notes were complex and had legal overhead
- Early investors didn't need interest or maturity dates
- Companies wanted simpler documentation

### How a SAFE Works:
1. Investor gives company money now
2. Company gives investor right to future shares
3. Next priced round triggers conversion
4. SAFE converts at a discount or cap (whichever gives more shares)

### SAFE Flavors:
**Pre-Money SAFE (Original):**
- Conversion happens before new money is counted
- Better for investors (more ownership)

**Post-Money SAFE (2018 Update):**
- Conversion happens after new money is counted
- Better for founders (clearer dilution)
- Now the standard version

### SAFE Example Calculation:
**Scenario:**
- Investor puts $100K into a SAFE with $5M valuation cap
- Later, company raises Series A at $10M pre-money valuation

**Conversion math:**
- Ownership at cap: $100K √∑ $5M = 2%
- Ownership at round price: $100K √∑ $10M = 1%
- SAFE investor gets the better deal: 2% of the company
- Equivalent shares: If company has 10,000,000 shares, investor gets 200,000 shares

**SAFE Calculation Joke:** "SAFE math is simple: You put in X dollars, the company grows for a while, and you get... well, your lawyer will need to calculate exactly what you get, but it's definitely more than nothing!" ü•Å

## Convertible Notes in Detail: The Classic Bridge üåâ

### Why Use Convertible Notes:
- Delay valuation discussion until company is more mature
- Faster/cheaper than priced equity round
- Bridge between major funding rounds

### Components of a Convertible Note:
1. **Principal:** The amount invested
2. **Interest Rate:** Annual interest (accrues until conversion)
3. **Maturity Date:** When note must convert or be repaid
4. **Conversion Discount:** Reduction off the next round price (e.g., 20%)
5. **Valuation Cap:** Maximum valuation for conversion calculation

### Conversion Scenarios:
**Qualified Financing:**
- Company raises substantial equity round
- Note automatically converts to preferred stock
- Price determined by discount or cap (whichever better for investor)

**Maturity:** 
- Note reaches maturity date without qualified financing
- Either converts to equity, gets extended, or must be repaid

**Change of Control:**
- Company gets acquired
- Note typically converts or gets repaid with premium (2X)

### Convertible Note Example:
**Scenario:**
- $250K note with 6% interest, 20% discount, $8M cap
- One year later, company raises $3M at $15M pre-money
- Interest accrued: $15K (6% of $250K)
- Total value: $265K

**Conversion price calculations:**
- Discount price: $15M valuation with 20% discount ‚Üí $12M effective valuation
- Cap price: $8M valuation
- Investor gets cap price (better deal)
- Ownership: $265K √∑ $8M = ~3.3% of company pre-new money

**Convertible Note Joke:** "A convertible note is what happens when debt and equity have a baby, and then the baby grows up to have very complicated paperwork." ü•Å

## Preferred Stock in Detail: The Investor's Best Friend üëë

### Why Investors Want Preferred Stock:
- Protection against downside risk
- Special rights and privileges
- Ability to block certain company decisions

### Key Preferred Stock Terms:
1. **Liquidation Preference:**
   - "1X non-participating" = Get your money back OR convert to common
   - "1X participating" = Get your money back AND get common stock percent
   - "Multiple preference" = Get 1.5X, 2X, etc. of your money back

2. **Anti-Dilution Protection:**
   - "Broad-based weighted average" = Some protection against down rounds
   - "Narrow-based weighted average" = More protection
   - "Full ratchet" = Maximum protection (very investor-friendly)

3. **Board Rights:**
   - Typically 1 board seat for Series A
   - More seats in later rounds
   - Usually major decisions need preferred director approval

4. **Pro-Rata Rights:**
   - Right to invest in future rounds to maintain percentage ownership
   - Helps investors avoid dilution

### Real-world Preferred Stock Example:
**Scenario:** 
- Investor puts $5M in Series A for 20% ownership at $25M post-money
- Company later sells for $20M (less than the post-money valuation)

**Without preference:** Investor would get 20% of $20M = $4M (loss of $1M)
**With 1X preference:** Investor gets $5M back first, then common splits remaining $15M

**Liquidation Preference Joke:** "Liquidation preference is like bringing your own life raft to a cruise ship. If everything goes well, you don't need it. If the ship sinks, you're very glad you brought it." ü•Å

## Warrants in Detail: The Long-Term Option üî≠

### Why Companies Issue Warrants:
- Sweetener for debt financing
- Incentive for strategic partnerships
- Alternative to cash payment for services

### Typical Warrant Terms:
- Exercise price: Often at recent 409A valuation
- Term: Usually 5-10 years (much longer than options)
- Typically not subject to vesting
- Usually immediately exercisable

### Warrant vs. Option Differences:
1. **Term length:** Warrants last much longer than options
2. **Recipients:** Options for employees, warrants for partners/investors
3. **Board approval:** Options need regular board approval, warrants are one-time
4. **Pool impact:** Options come from option pool, warrants don't

### Real-world Warrant Example:
**Scenario:**
- Startup gets $3M venture debt from bank
- Bank also receives warrant for 1% of company
- Company has 10,000,000 shares outstanding
- Warrant covers 100,000 shares at $2.00/share
- If company exits at $15/share, bank can exercise for $200,000 and receive shares worth $1,500,000

**Warrant Joke:** "A warrant is like a backstage pass that lets you buy shares at yesterday's prices, but you can wait until the band is famous before deciding if you want to use it." ü•Å

## RSUs in Detail: The Later-Stage Equity Solution üìä

### Why Companies Use RSUs:
- High share price makes options expensive to exercise
- Tax efficiency for employees in certain scenarios
- No need for employees to pay exercise price
- Common at pre-IPO and public companies

### How RSUs Work:
1. Company grants RSUs with time-based vesting (e.g., 4 years)
2. RSUs have no value until they vest
3. When they vest AND the company has IPO'd, employee receives actual shares
4. Shares are taxed as income when received
5. Company typically withholds some shares for tax payment

### Double-Trigger Vesting:
1. **Time-based trigger:** Standard vesting schedule (e.g., 4 years)
2. **Liquidity trigger:** IPO, acquisition, or secondary offering
3. Both must occur for RSUs to turn into shares

### RSU Example Calculation:
**Scenario:**
- Employee granted 10,000 RSUs
- 4-year vesting with 1-year cliff
- Company IPOs after 2 years
- Share price at vesting: $20

**At 2-year mark:**
- 5,000 RSUs have vested (50%)
- Value: $100,000
- Taxes due immediately (unlike options)
- Company withholds ~3,000 shares for taxes
- Employee receives ~2,000 actual shares

**RSU Joke:** "RSUs are the 'adulting' version of equity compensation. No need to figure out how to exercise or where to get the money‚Äîbut get ready for a tax bill!" ü•Å

## How Financial Instruments Affect Your Equity: The Dilution Effect üìâ

### 1. Convertible Notes and SAFEs:
- Convert into preferred stock in next round
- Create "overhang" (future dilution not yet reflected)
- Can dilute common stock unexpectedly if caps are low

**Example:** $1M in SAFEs at $5M cap convert into 20% ownership when Series A happens, diluting everyone else.

### 2. Multiple Liquidation Preferences:
- Reduce proceeds available to common stockholders
- Create waterfall of payments in exit
- Can result in common stock getting nothing in modest exits

**Example:** If investors put in $30M with 1X preference and company sells for $40M, only $10M goes to common stock.

### 3. Anti-Dilution Provisions:
- Protect investors in down rounds
- Issue additional shares to earlier investors
- Further dilute common stockholders

**Example:** Series A investors at $10/share get extra shares if Series B is at $5/share, diluting founders and employees more.

### 4. Option Pool Expansions:
- Create dilution before new investment
- Often pushed on founders by investors
- Affect existing shareholders but not new investors

**Example:** Increasing option pool from 10% to 15% creates 5% dilution for current shareholders before new money comes in.

**Dilution Joke:** "Dilution is like adding water to soup‚Äîinvestors insist on having the same amount of soup, so the founders and employees just end up with increasingly watery portions." ü•Å

## Real-World Financial Instrument Story: The BioTech Rollercoaster üé¢

Let's follow a fictional biotech startup called "CellRenew" through its funding journey:

### Year 0: Formation
- Two PhD founders incorporate company
- Each gets 2 million common shares (4M total)
- Self-valued at $2M ($0.50/share)

**Initial cap table:**
```
Founders: 4M shares (100%)
```

### Year 1: Friends & Family
- Raise $500K using SAFEs
- $5M valuation cap, no discount
- Will convert in future round

**Updated cap table (not including SAFE conversion yet):**
```
Founders: 4M shares (100%)
SAFE noteholders: Will convert later
```

### Year 2: Seed Round
- Raise $2M on convertible notes
- $10M cap, 20% discount
- 18-month maturity
- Previous SAFEs convert

**Updated cap table (showing fully diluted with notes converted):**
```
Founders: 4M shares (66.7%)
SAFE holders: 500K shares (8.3%) [based on $5M cap]
Note holders: 1.5M shares (25%) [based on $10M cap]
Total: 6M fully diluted shares
```

### Year 4: Series A
- Raise $8M at $20M pre-money
- Notes convert automatically
- Create 15% option pool
- Series A investors get 1X liquidation preference

**Updated cap table:**
```
Founders: 3.4M shares (42.5%)
Former SAFE holders: 500K shares (6.25%)
Former Note holders: 1.5M shares + interest (20%)
Series A investors: 2M shares (25%)
Option pool: 500K shares already issued (6.25%)
Remaining pool: 700K shares reserved
Total: 8M fully diluted shares
```

### Year 7: Acquisition Offer
- Big Pharma offers $50M for CellRenew
- Series A has 1X liquidation preference ($8M)
- Remaining $42M distributed according to ownership

**Distribution of proceeds:**
```
Series A investors: $8M preference + $10.5M common = $18.5M
Founders: $17.85M
Former SAFE holders: $2.6M
Former Note holders: $8.4M
Employees with options: $2.65M
Total: $50M
```

**Acquisition Joke:** "After 7 years, millions in research, and countless sleepless nights, the founders sold their company for $50 million. After paying off preferences, they each got $8.9M. Their hourly rate worked out to approximately $13.50 per hour." ü•Å

## How To Read Term Sheets: Decoding the Legal Jargon üîé

### 1. Economic Terms (Money Issues):
- **Valuation:** Pre-money vs. post-money
- **Option pool:** Size and when it's created (pre-money expansion?)
- **Liquidation preference:** Multiple and participation rights
- **Employee option vesting:** Standard is 4 years, 1-year cliff
- **Founder vesting:** Often imposed on founders retrospectively

### 2. Control Terms (Power Issues):
- **Board composition:** Who controls the board
- **Protective provisions:** What decisions need investor approval
- **Drag-along rights:** Can majority force minority to sell
- **Right of first refusal:** Company/investors can buy shares before others
- **Pro-rata rights:** Investors can maintain ownership percentage

### 3. Information Terms:
- **Information rights:** What financial info investors receive
- **Inspection rights:** Whether investors can inspect facilities/books
- **Reporting frequency:** Monthly, quarterly, annually

### 4. Red Flags to Watch For:
- **Multiple liquidation preferences:** More than 1X return before common gets anything
- **Full-ratchet anti-dilution:** Extremely punitive in down rounds
- **Excessive board control:** Investors controlling board with minority ownership
- **Aggressive vesting on founder shares:** Especially without acceleration provisions
- **No employee option pool:** Makes it hard to hire talent

**Term Sheet Joke:** "A startup term sheet contains 20 pages of legal language that basically says: 'The investors get all the good stuff, the founders get whatever's left, and employees get nice t-shirts.'" ü•Å

## Financial Instruments in Simple Terms: The 5-Year-Old Explanation üë∂

**5-year-old version:** "Imagine your friend Jake has a lemonade stand. Different people want to help Jake's lemonade stand grow:

- Common stock is like saying 'I own part of the lemonade stand!'
- Preferred stock is like saying 'I own part of the lemonade stand, and I get the first cups of lemonade every day!'
- A convertible note is like giving Jake money and saying 'Let me help now, and when your stand gets bigger, I'll decide exactly how many cups I get to own.'
- A SAFE is like saying 'I'll give you money now, and someday when your lemonade stand is really big, I'll own a piece of it.'
- A warrant is like saying 'I might want to buy cups of your lemonade later, but at today's prices.'"

## DIY Financial Instrument Choice: The Strategy Game üéØ

Let's decide which instrument makes sense in different situations:

### Scenario 1: Pre-seed Startup
- Just an idea and team
- Raising $300K from angels
- No clear valuation benchmark

**Best instrument:** SAFE with $5M cap, no discount
**Why:** Avoids valuation discussion, simple paperwork, no maturity pressure

### Scenario 2: Bridge Financing
- Running low on cash before Series B
- Need $1M to extend runway 6 months
- Series A was at $15M post-money

**Best instrument:** Convertible note with 20% discount, $20M cap
**Why:** Time pressure needs quick closing, discount rewards risk, cap provides upside

### Scenario 3: Strategic Partnership
- Corporation wants investment rights
- Will also be customer and partner
- Company already raised Series A

**Best instrument:** Warrant coverage alongside partnership agreement
**Why:** Aligns incentives long-term without immediate equity impact

### Scenario 4: Series A Round
- Proven product with early traction
- Raising $5M from venture capital
- Clear comparable companies for valuation

**Best instrument:** Preferred Stock (Series A)
**Why:** Standard for institutional VC, appropriate for size/stage, allows proper terms

## Common Financial Instrument Mistakes: The Pitfall Patrol üï≥Ô∏è

### 1. Not Understanding Conversion Mechanics
Failing to model how SAFEs/notes will convert in future rounds

### 2. Accepting Multiple Liquidation Preferences
Creating scenarios where common stock gets little in modest acquisitions

### 3. Stacking Too Many Convertible Instruments
Creating complex conversion waterfalls that frighten future investors

### 4. Ignoring Dilution from Future Option Pools
Not accounting for additional dilution from expanding option pools

### 5. Missing Tax Implications
Not planning for tax events when instruments convert or vest

## Financial Instrument Memes to Remember üòÇ
