# Lesson 8: Liquidity Events - When Your Equity Finally Becomes Money üí∏

## What are Liquidity Events? The Equity Cash Machine üè¶

Imagine you've spent years collecting rare baseball cards, but can't actually spend them at the grocery store. Suddenly, a collector offers to buy your entire collection for cash. That's essentially what a **liquidity event** is for your startup equity!

A liquidity event is any transaction that allows shareholders to convert their illiquid equity (stock or options) into cash or marketable securities. These are the moments when paper wealth potentially becomes real money in your bank account.

### The Treasure Hunt Analogy:

```
üèùÔ∏è Startup = Treasure island
üó∫Ô∏è Equity = Map showing your share of treasure
‚õèÔ∏è Working at company = Digging for treasure
üí∞ Liquidity event = Finally finding and cashing in the treasure
üö¢ Different exit routes = Different ways off the island with your gold
```

## Types of Liquidity Events: The Exit Multiverse üåê

### 1. Initial Public Offering (IPO): The Grand Debut üé≠
- **What happens:** Company lists shares on a public stock exchange
- **Who buys:** Public market investors, institutions, retail traders
- **Timeline:** Typically 7-10+ years from company founding
- **Process length:** 6-9 months from decision to listing day
- **Key players:** Investment banks, SEC, stock exchanges, lawyers
- **Employee impact:** Can sell shares after lockup period (typically 180 days)
- **Famous examples:** Facebook (2012), Airbnb (2020), Spotify (2018)

### 2. Direct Listing: The Self-Made Debut üé¨
- **What happens:** Company lists directly on exchange without raising new capital
- **Who buys:** Public market investors trading existing shares
- **Timeline:** Similar to IPO timeframe but slightly faster process
- **Process length:** 3-6 months
- **Key players:** Advisors, stock exchanges, existing shareholders
- **Employee impact:** Often no lockup or shorter lockup period
- **Famous examples:** Slack (2019), Coinbase (2021), Palantir (2020)

### 3. SPAC Merger: The Shortcut üèéÔ∏è
- **What happens:** Merger with already-public "blank check" company
- **Who buys:** SPAC already has public shareholders
- **Timeline:** Can accelerate timeline by 1-2 years
- **Process length:** 3-6 months
- **Key players:** SPAC sponsors, investors, lawyers
- **Employee impact:** Variable lockups based on merger agreement
- **Famous examples:** Virgin Galactic, DraftKings, OpenDoor

### 4. Acquisition: The Corporate Marriage üíí
- **What happens:** Larger company buys the entire company
- **Who buys:** Strategic acquirer or private equity firm
- **Timeline:** Can happen at any stage (even pre-revenue)
- **Process length:** 3-9 months from LOI to closing
- **Key players:** Acquiring company, board, M&A advisors
- **Employee impact:** Immediate liquidity or earn-out period
- **Famous examples:** Instagram (by Facebook), LinkedIn (by Microsoft), Slack (by Salesforce)

### 5. Secondary Sales: The Private Cash-Out üíº
- **What happens:** Private transaction allowing shareholders to sell some shares
- **Who buys:** VCs, private equity, special purpose vehicles
- **Timeline:** Can happen at any stage after Series B typically
- **Process length:** 1-3 months
- **Key players:** Board, existing investors, new investors
- **Employee impact:** Selective liquidity for certain employees/amounts
- **Famous examples:** Pre-IPO Facebook, Airbnb, SpaceX employee secondaries

**Exit Route Joke:** "Startup founders are like GPS systems that only know three destinations: IPO Avenue, Acquisition Boulevard, or Bankruptcy Lane. But employees need to know all the side streets too!" ü•Å

## IPOs in Detail: The Public Market Graduation üéì

### The IPO Process Step by Step:
1. **Preparation Phase (6-12 months before)**
   - Select investment banks (underwriters)
   - Begin financial audits and compliance work
   - Draft S-1 registration statement
   - Board approves IPO plan

2. **Filing Phase (3-6 months before)**
   - File S-1 with SEC
   - Respond to SEC comments
   - Update financial information
   - Begin drafting roadshow presentation

3. **Marketing Phase (2-4 weeks before)**
   - Roadshow (presenting to potential investors)
   - Building the order book (collecting investor interest)
   - Pricing discussions

4. **Pricing Night (day before)**
   - Final share price determined
   - Underwriting agreement signed
   - Shares allocated to investors

5. **First Trading Day**
   - Shares begin trading on exchange
   - Stock typically opens above IPO price (the "pop")
   - Company officially public

6. **Post-IPO (after listing)**
   - Lock-up period for employees (typically 180 days)
   - Quiet period for company communications
   - First earnings report as public company

### What Happens to Your Equity in an IPO:
- **Options:** Remain options, but now for publicly traded stock
- **Exercise window:** Usually unchanged (still need to exercise)
- **Lockup period:** Typically can't sell for 180 days
- **Tax implications:** Still pay taxes upon exercise and sale
- **Post-lockup:** Can sell shares on public market (or hold)

### IPO Logistics for Employees:
- **Broker accounts:** Company usually sets up with specific broker
- **Trading windows:** Even after lockup, trading restrictions apply
- **10b5-1 plans:** Scheduled selling to avoid insider trading concerns
- **Tax withholding:** Company may withhold shares for tax payment

**IPO Joke:** "The good news: after 7 years of hard work, your stock is finally liquid! The bad news: you can't sell for 6 months, and the stock price dropped 40% the day your lockup expired!" ü•Å

### Real-world IPO Example: Imaginary SaaS Company "CloudBoost"
- Founded 2016
- IPO in 2024
- 500 employees
- $100 million annual revenue
- IPO price: $20 per share
- First day close: $28 per share
- Market cap: $3 billion

**Early employee equity journey:**
- Joined 2017, granted 20,000 options at $1 strike
- IPO time: Fully vested
- Paper value at IPO: $380,000 ($20-1 √ó 20,000)
- Cost to exercise: $20,000
- After lockup: Sells half at $25 per share
- Gross proceeds: $250,000
- Less exercise cost: $10,000
- Less taxes: ~$60,000
- Net cash: ~$180,000
- Remaining shares: Worth $250,000 (at $25/share)

**IPO Reality Joke:** "The fantasy: 'I'll make millions in the IPO!' The reality: 'After paying taxes, exercising costs, and the market drop, I made just enough to put a down payment on a house... in the distant suburbs.'" ü•Å

## Acquisitions in Detail: The Corporate Buyout üõí

### Types of Acquisitions:
1. **Cash deal:** 100% payment in cash
2. **Stock deal:** 100% payment in acquiring company stock
3. **Mixed deal:** Combination of cash and stock
4. **Earnout:** Additional payments based on future performance

### Acquisition Process Overview:
1. **Initial contact and interest**
   - Strategic discussions or formal auction process
   - Non-disclosure agreements signed

2. **Preliminary agreement**
   - Letter of Intent (LOI) signed
   - Exclusivity period begins
   - Basic terms outlined

3. **Due diligence phase**
   - Buyer examines everything about the business
   - Legal, financial, technical, HR reviews

4. **Definitive agreement negotiation**
   - Detailed merger or acquisition agreement
   - Reps & warranties, escrow, indemnification

5. **Signing and announcement**

8. **Integration**
   - Systems combined
   - Teams reorganized
   - Synergies implemented

### What Happens to Your Equity in an Acquisition:
- **Vested options:** Typically must be exercised or cashed out
- **Unvested options:** May be assumed by acquirer or accelerated
- **Vested shares:** Acquired for deal consideration
- **Indemnification:** Portion may be held in escrow
- **Transaction bonus:** Some employees may receive extra

### Acquisition Consideration Types:
- **Cash:** Immediate payment, clear value, taxed immediately
- **Stock:** Less certain value, potential tax deferral, future upside
- **Cash + Stock:** Blend of certainty and upside
- **Earnout:** Additional payments tied to performance goals

**Acquisition Joke:** "The company was acquired for $500 million! Which sounds amazing until you realize the investors get the first $300 million, management gets $100 million in retention packages, and the remaining $100 million is split among 500 employees based on a formula that requires a PhD in mathematics to understand." ü•Å

### Real-world Acquisition Example: Imaginary AI Startup "VoiceGenius"
- Founded 2020
- Acquired 2024 by BigTech Inc.
- 75 employees
- $5 million annual revenue
- Acquisition price: $200 million (mostly cash)
- Reason: Strategic technology acquisition

**Early engineer equity journey:**
- Joined 2021, granted 30,000 options at $0.50 strike
- Acquisition time: 75% vested (22,500 vested options)
- Single-trigger acceleration: Remaining 7,500 options accelerate
- Total options: 30,000 vested
- Value per share in acquisition: $10
- Gross value: $300,000
- Less exercise cost: $15,000
- Less taxes: ~$70,000
- Net cash: ~$215,000
- Plus retention package: $100,000 over 2 years

**Acquisition Reality Joke:** "When your startup gets acquired, the founders buy Lamborghinis, the investors buy vacation homes, and you get enough money to pay off your student loans and maybe buy a certified pre-owned Honda Accord." ü•Å

## Secondary Sales in Detail: The Private Liquidity Option üí±

Secondary sales are becoming increasingly common as companies stay private longer. These transactions allow existing shareholders to sell some portion of their equity without a full exit event.

### Types of Secondary Transactions:
1. **Company-sponsored:** Official program run by the company
2. **Investor-led:** VC firms buying from employees
3. **Third-party secondary funds:** Specialized buyers of private company stock
4. **Individual transactions:** One-off sales (often needing board approval)

### Secondary Sale Process:
1. **Initiation**
   - Company announces program OR
   - Investor expresses interest OR
   - Employee seeks permission to sell

2. **Eligibility determination**
   - Which employees can participate
   - What percentage of holdings can be sold
   - Any minimum tenure requirements

3. **Pricing establishment**
   - Based on recent financing OR
   - Independent valuation OR
   - Negotiated price (often at discount)

4. **Transaction execution**
   - Exercise of options (if applicable)
   - Transfer of shares
   - Payment processing
   - Tax withholding

### What Happens to Your Equity in a Secondary Sale:
- **Partial liquidity:** Usually limited to 10-25% of your holdings
- **Exercise requirement:** Must exercise options before selling
- **Tax implications:** Typically ordinary income tax rates
- **Approval process:** ROFR (Right of First Refusal) often applies
- **Remaining equity:** Still subject to normal vesting/rules

### Secondary Sale Example:
- Company valuation: $1 billion
- Common stock discount: 20%
- Secondary transaction price: $8 per share
- Employee with 100,000 vested options at $1 strike
- Allowed to sell 20,000 shares (20%)
- Proceed steps:
  1. Exercise 20,000 options for $20,000
  2. Sell shares for $160,000
  3. Net before taxes: $140,000
  4. After taxes (approx.): $85,000

**Secondary Sale Joke:** "A secondary sale is like being allowed to eat 20% of your cake now, while still hoping the remaining 80% grows bigger instead of going stale. Except the first 20% is taxed at up to 37% by the federal government." ü•Å

## Direct Listings and SPACs: The Alternative Public Pathways üõ£Ô∏è

Traditional IPOs aren't the only way to go public anymore. Let's explore the new alternatives:

### Direct Listings:
- **Key difference from IPO:** No new capital raised
- **Pricing mechanism:** Pure market-based opening auction
- **Costs:** Lower banking fees than traditional IPO
- **Lock-up:** Often shorter or staggered lock-up periods
- **Who can sell:** All eligible shareholders from day one
- **Process length:** 3-6 months (faster than IPO)

**Direct Listing Example: "DataViz Inc."**
- Traditional IPO banks wanted to price at $30-35
- Company opted for direct listing
- Opening price: $45
- First week trading range: $42-48
- Employees could sell 25% immediately
- Staged lockup release over 3 months

**Direct Listing Joke:** "In a direct listing, the company says to investment banks: 'Thanks for offering to take 7% of our money to sell our shares, but we'll just put them on the market and see what happens.'" ü•Å

### SPACs (Special Purpose Acquisition Companies):
- **What they are:** Already-public "blank check" companies
- **Process:** SPAC merges with private company, making it public
- **Timeline advantage:** Can be faster than traditional IPO
- **Certainty:** Price negotiated upfront, not market-determined
- **Projections:** Can include forward projections (unlike IPOs)
- **Post-merger performance:** Historically mixed/underperforming

**SPAC Example: "RocketMobility"**
- Electric scooter startup
- Pre-revenue but growing deployment
- Traditional IPO path: 2+ years away
- SPAC offer: $1.2 billion valuation
- Deal structure:
  - $300M cash from SPAC
  - $200M PIPE (additional investment)
  - Existing shareholders roll 100% equity

**SPAC Joke:** "A SPAC is like an IPO with a time machine. You get to be a public company now based on what you promise to become in five years. What could possibly go wrong?" ü•Å

## What Happens to Different Equity Types in Liquidity Events üìä

Different types of equity are treated differently during exits. Here's how each type typically behaves:

### 1. Stock Options in Liquidity Events:
- **IPO scenario:**
  - Must exercise to get actual shares
  - Subject to lockup (typically 180 days)
  - Need cash to exercise before selling
  - Potential AMT tax implications
  - Post-lockup, can sell on public market

- **Acquisition scenario:**
  - Often "cashed out" (net exercise)
  - Company may cover exercise costs
  - Unvested options may accelerate or convert
  - Calculated as: (acquisition price - strike price) √ó # options

### 2. Restricted Stock Units (RSUs) in Liquidity Events:
- **IPO scenario:**
  - Double-trigger RSUs convert to actual shares
  - Taxed as income upon vesting/settlement
  - Typically some shares sold for tax withholding
  - Remaining shares subject to lockup
  - Post-lockup, can sell on public market

- **Acquisition scenario:**
  - Unvested RSUs often accelerate or convert
  - Treated as income at fair market value
  - Taxes typically withheld

### 3. Restricted Stock/Early Exercise in Liquidity Events:
- **IPO scenario:**
  - Already actual shares, no exercise needed
  - Subject to standard lockup
  - May have already filed 83(b), favorable tax treatment

- **Acquisition scenario:**
  - Unvested shares typically accelerate
  - Receives full consideration like any shareholder
  - Better tax treatment if held long-term

### 4. SAFEs and Convertible Notes in Liquidity Events:
- **IPO scenario:**
  - Automatically convert to shares before IPO
  - Subject to normal lockup provisions

- **Acquisition scenario:**
  - Convert to equity before acquisition OR
  - Paid out based on conversion terms OR
  - Specific payout terms in acquisition agreement

**Equity Type Joke:** "The difference between options and RSUs in an exit is like the difference between having to assemble IKEA furniture before you can sell it versus getting pre-assembled furniture that's ready to sell... but the tax man takes half of the pre-assembled stuff." ü•Å

## Acquisition Terms That Affect Your Payout: The Fine Print üîç

When acquisitions happen, the details matter enormously for employee outcomes. Here are key terms to understand:

### 1. Purchase Price Allocation:
- How the total price is divided among equity holders
- Affected by liquidation preferences of preferred stock
- Waterfall structure determines who gets paid first

### 2. Escrow and Holdbacks:
- Portion of proceeds held back (typically 10-15%)
- Protection for buyer against undisclosed issues
- Released after 12-18 months if no claims
- All shareholders typically contribute proportionally

### 3. Management Carveout:
- Special pool of money for key employees
- Outside the standard equity distribution
- Can significantly benefit executives
- May leave less for regular equity holders

### 4. Earnouts:
- Additional payments if company hits future goals
- Can be substantial portion of total deal value
- Often challenging to achieve
- May require continued employment

### 5. Acceleration of Vesting:
- Single trigger: Accelerates with change of control
- Double trigger: Accelerates if terminated after acquisition
- Full vs. partial acceleration (e.g., 50% or 100%)
- Negotiated in option agreement or acquisition

### 6. Retention Packages:
- New compensation to keep key employees
- Often includes new vesting schedule
- Can be cash, acquirer stock, or both
- Critical for acquirer to preserve value

**Acquisition Terms Joke:** "Reading acquisition agreements is like finding out there's an asterisk next to the $10 million prize on a game show. 'Congratulations, you've won $10 million!* *Subject to 18-month escrow, proportional indemnification obligations, achievement of performance metrics, continued employment, and we'll only pay in cryptocurrency.'" ü•Å

## How Investors Get Paid First: Preference Stacks ü•û

One of the most important factors affecting employee payouts in acquisitions is the liquidation preference stack. Here's how it typically works:

### Liquidation Preference Basics:
- **Definition:** Right of preferred shareholders to get paid before common
- **Standard terms:** "1X non-participating" (most common)
- **Aggressive terms:** "Multiple preference" or "participating preferred"
- **Multiple rounds:** Creates "preference stack" in order of seniority

### Preference Waterfall Example:
**Company cap table before exit:**
- Series C: $40M invested (1X preference)
- Series B: $25M invested (1X preference)
- Series A: $10M invested (1X preference)
- Common stock: Founders and employees (15M shares)

**Scenario 1: $200M exit (great outcome)**
- Series C gets: $40M preference or convert to common
- Series B gets: $25M preference or convert to common
- Series A gets: $10M preference or convert to common
- All convert to common (better outcome for them)
- Proceeds distributed based on ownership percentage
- Employees with common get proportional share

**Scenario 2: $100M exit (decent outcome)**
- Series C gets: $40M preference
- Series B gets: $25M preference
- Series A gets: $10M preference
- Common gets: Remaining $25M
- Employees get significantly less than proportional ownership

**Scenario 3: $50M exit (disappointing outcome)**
- Series C gets: $40M preference
- Series B gets: $10M remaining
- Series A gets: $0
- Common stock: $0 (employees get nothing)

**Preference Stack Joke:** "Liquidation preferences are like being on a sinking ship where first-class passengers get all the lifeboats, and everyone in economy gets to fight over pool noodles." ü•Å

## Employee Concerns in Exit Events: The Survival Guide üß†

As an employee, you need to be prepared for the practical and emotional realities of liquidity events:

### 1. Financial Planning Considerations:
- **Tax planning:** Work with accountant before liquidity
- **Exercise strategy:** Optimal timing for option exercise
- **Diversification:** Don't keep all wealth in one stock
- **Cash needs:** Plan for taxes and exercise costs
- **Windfall management:** Professional advice for sudden wealth

### 2. Career Considerations:
- **Retention requirements:** Understand what's required to get full payout
- **New role clarity:** What will your job be post-acquisition?
- **Cultural fit:** Will you be happy in the acquiring company?
- **Future equity:** What new equity package will you receive?
- **Resume impact:** How does this exit position your career?

### 3. Psychological Considerations:
- **Sudden wealth syndrome:** Emotional impact of financial change
- **Post-exit letdown:** Common after years of intensity
- **Identity shift:** When your startup identity disappears
- **Team changes:** Losing close-knit culture and colleagues
- **Next steps anxiety:** "What do I do now?"

### 4. Practical Exit Checklist:
- **Gather documents:** All equity agreements, grant notices, exercises
- **Understand timing:** Key dates for decisions, tax payments
- **Know your numbers:** Exact shares/options, vesting status, exercise prices
- **Build your team:** Accountant, financial advisor, attorney
- **Scenario planning:** Model different outcomes and timelines
- **Communication clarity:** Questions to ask leadership

**Exit Reality Joke:** "Nobody tells you that after working 80-hour weeks for 5 years to reach an exit, you'll spend the first month post-acquisition in back-to-back integration meetings discussing how to migrate your email to a new system." ü•Å

## Maximizing Your Outcome: Strategic Moves üìà

Here are strategic considerations to optimize your position in a liquidity event:

### Before Any Exit is on the Horizon:
- **Negotiate acceleration terms:** When receiving equity grants
- **Consider early exercise:** If available and financially feasible
- **Understand documents:** Know triggers and terms
- **File 83(b) elections:** When appropriate for tax benefits
- **Keep records:** Maintain all equity documentation

### When Exit Rumors Begin:
- **Evaluate exercise timing:** Consider tax implications
- **Understand vesting impact:** How much will be vested by likely exit?
- **Network for information:** Build relationships to stay informed
- **Financial preparation:** Arrange liquidity for potential exercises
- **Refresh grants:** Negotiate additional equity if possible

### During Exit Process:
- **Ask important questions:** Leadership, investors, advisors
- **Retention package:** Negotiate your ongoing value
- **Tax planning:** Work with professionals immediately
- **Review all documents:** Scrutinize what you're asked to sign
- **Consider alternatives:** Different timing or structures

### Immediately After Announcement:
- **Maximize acceleration:** Ensure all eligible equity accelerates
- **Clarify new role/comp:** Get post-acquisition details in writing
- **Exercise strategy:** Decide optimal approach for options
- **Sale timing:** Plan for lockups and trading windows
- **Tax mitigation:** Use available strategies

**Strategy Joke:** "The best time to negotiate your acquisition terms was when you joined the company. The second-best time is when the company can't complete the acquisition without your cooperation." ü•Å

## Real-World Exit Case Studies: Tales from the Trenches üìö

Let's look at three realistic but fictional exit scenarios and how they affected employees:

### Case Study 1: The Disappointing Acquisition
**Company:** MobileAds Inc.
- Founded 2016, adtech platform
- Raised $22M total across seed, A & B rounds
- 1X liquidation preferences on all rounds
- Struggled to grow revenue after iOS privacy changes
- Sold for $18M to larger competitor in 2023
- 50 employees, 15% option pool

**Outcome for employees:**
- Series B investors: $15M (their full preference)
- Series A investors: $3M (partial preference)
- Common holders: $0 (nothing)
- Mid-level engineer with 0.3% fully vested: $0
- Founders gave 20% of their proceeds to create small pool for employees

**Lesson:** Even with "standard" 1X preferences, disappointing exits often leave little for common stockholders.

### Case Study 2: The "Unicorn" IPO
**Company:** DeliveryDash
- On-demand delivery startup
- Founded 2015, IPO in 2023
- Raised $300M at $2.2B final private valuation
- IPO price: $40 per share, $4B valuation
- First day pop: Closed at $72 (+80%)
- Six months later: Trading at $22 (-45% from IPO)

**Outcome for employees:**
- Early employee (2016) with 50,000 options at $2:
  - Paper value at IPO: $1.9M
  - After lockup at $22: $1M
  - After taxes and exercise costs: ~$650K
- Late employee (2021) with 10,000 options at $25:
  - Underwater after price fell below strike price

**Lesson:** IPOs can be volatile, and lockup expirations often coincide with price drops.

### Case Study 3: The Successful Strategic Acquisition
**Company:** AITools Inc.
- Enterprise AI software
- Founded 2018, acquired 2024
- Raised $40M at $200M last valuation
- Acquired by tech giant for $500M cash
- Strong revenue growth, strategic technology fit
- 100 employees, standard vesting terms

**Outcome for employees:**
- Preferences satisfied (1X non-participating)
- Common stockholders received ~$300M collectively
- Early engineer (0.5%) with fully vested options: $1.5M
- Mid-stage PM (0.2%) halfway through vesting: $500K + $300K retention
- Recent hire (0.1%) with minimal vesting: $50K + new equity package

**Lesson:** Clean acquisitions at significant premiums to last valuation can create good outcomes across the employee base.

**Case Study Joke:** "Startup exits are like snowflakes: they each disappoint employees in their own unique way." ü•Å

## Liquidity Events in Simple Terms: The 5-Year-Old Explanation üë∂

**5-year-old version:** "Imagine you and your friends spend years building a really cool sandcastle. You each get a special ticket showing which part of the castle belongs to you. But you can't do anything with those tickets except keep building the castle. Then one day, a grown-up comes along and says 'Wow! I love your castle!' They offer to buy the whole castle, giving everyone real money for their tickets. Or maybe they put up a sign saying 'Come see this amazing sandcastle' and lots of people pay to visit, and those tickets can now be traded for real money. That's what happens when a company has a liquidity event - all those pieces of paper that say you own part of the company finally turn into real money you can spend!"

## DIY Liquidity Scenario Planning: Be Prepared üèóÔ∏è

Let's create a simple tool to estimate your outcomes in different exit scenarios:

1. **Gather your key numbers:**
   - Total options/shares: 25,000
   - Strike price: $2.00
   - Vesting status: 75% vested (18,750 vested shares)
   - Acceleration terms: None (standard)
   - Company's fully-diluted shares: 10 million
   - Your ownership percentage: 0.25%

2. **Create scenario matrix:**

   **Scenario A: IPO**
   - IPO Price: $20 per share
   - Post-lockup price: $25 per share
   - Value of vested shares: $431,250 (18,750 √ó ($25-$2))
   - Exercise cost: $37,500 (18,750 √ó $2)
   - Approximate tax: $100,000
   - Net proceeds: ~$293,750

   **Scenario B: Strong Acquisition**
   - Acquisition price: $500 million ($50/share)
   - Value of vested shares: $900,000 (18,750 √ó ($50-$2))
   - Exercise handled through transaction
   - Approximate tax: $225,000
   - Net proceeds: ~$675,000

   **Scenario C: Modest Acquisition**
   - Acquisition price: $200 million ($20/share)
   - Value of vested shares: $337,500 (18,750 √ó ($20-$2))
   - Exercise handled through transaction
   - Approximate tax: $84,000
   - Net proceeds: ~$253,500

   **Scenario D: Disappointing Exit**
   - Acquisition price: $100 million ($10/share)
   - Value of vested shares: $150,000 (18,750 √ó ($10-$2))
   - Exercise handled through transaction
   - Approximate tax: $37,500
   - Net proceeds: ~$112,500

3. **Adjust for preferences and escrow:**
   - Preferences: Assume $50M total
   - Escrow: Typically 10-15% held for 18 months

4. **Final calculation for Modest Acquisition:**
   - After preferences: $150M remaining for common
   - Your share: $375,000 (0.25% of $150M)
   - Less exercise cost: $37,500
   - Pre-tax: $337,500
   - After tax: ~$253,000
   - Escrow: $38,000 held back
   - Initial payment: ~$215,000
   - Escrow release (later): ~$38,000

**Planning Joke:** "The first rule of startup liquidity planning is to divide your expected outcome by 2. The second rule is to divide that number by 2 again. If you're still excited, you're probably a founder." ü•Å

## Common Liquidity Event Mistakes: The Danger Zone ‚ö†Ô∏è

### 1. Not Understanding the Full Exit Structure
Focusing only on headline number without considering preferences

### 2. Poor Exercise Timing
Exercising too early (cash flow/tax risk) or too late (missing opportunities)

### 3. Concentration Risk
Failing to diversify after liquidity event

### 4. Tax Surprises
Not planning for AMT, ordinary income, capital gains implications

### 5. Assuming All Exit Payments Come at Once
Not accounting for escrow, earnouts, retention requirements

## Liquidity Event Memes to Remember üòÇ

![Employee watching company announce "$500M acquisition": "Wow, I own 0.1%! That's $500K! Oh wait, preferences... escrow... taxes... So it's more like $180K... in 18 months... if I don't quit."]

![Stock price chart showing big drop right at lockup expiration: "The magical moment when thousands of employees can finally sell their shares, and absolutely everyone tries to do it simultaneously."]
